# Example Project

This directory contains a basic example Liquid project. Take a look at the workspace [.vscode/settings.json](https://github.com/panoply/vscode-liquid-sample/blob/master/.vscode/settings.json) file and the [.liquidrc](https://github.com/panoply/vscode-liquid-sample/blob/master/.liquidrc) file to better understand how the extension is working and the settings being used.

### Files

There are a couple of basic `*.liquid` files located in the _src_ directory. The contents are purposefully unformatted. The files located in the _src/injection_ directory show the injection grammars being applied. The files located in the _src/suffixed_ directory show languages infused with Liquid. The `src/ignore-file.liquid` file is excluded from formatting as per the `ignore` setting defined in the .liquidrc file. Lastly, the _src/index.liquid_ file contains Liquid + Markup.
